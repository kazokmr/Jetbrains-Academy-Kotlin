## About

Tipping is a way to show your satisfaction and your gratitude for the service you get. However, it's a pain in the neck
to calculate the amount of tip, so let's create a handy tool that will make it easier!

## Learning outcomes

You will get to know the basics of Android development such as application layout, widgets, and events. The final
application will calculate the tip amount based on the bill and the tip percentage.
