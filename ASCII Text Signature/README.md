# Project: ASCII Text Signature

This project is by Jetbrains Academy.

## About

When learning a new programming language, we always have to figure out how to print text data. It is a simple and useful

There is only one problem: the text itself isn’t pretty enough for your taste. What if we try to add a little “make-up”?
Or get very creative with fonts, draw awesome letters with other letters?

Let’s try this out.

## Learning outcomes

You will learn to use the famous triad: for, while, and when, and also take a glance at functions and files.
