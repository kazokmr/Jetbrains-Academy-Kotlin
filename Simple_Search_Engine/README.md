https://hyperskill.org/projects/89

This project is by Jetbrains Academy.

## About

In this project you will create your own search engine, though it probably won’t compete with Google. Yours will be a
simple search engine that processes a limited collection of data and searches it for a word or a phrase. It’ll be simple
but cool.

## Learning outcomes

Gain confidence in your ability to work with files and the console, and learn how to optimize the search process.
