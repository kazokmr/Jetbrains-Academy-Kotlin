# Project: Minesweeper

This project is by Jetbrains Academy.

## About

They say a minesweeper makes only two mistakes in their life: the first is their choice of occupation, and the second
one is fatal. In this project, you will create your own, safe "Minesweeper" â€“ a game that will be a brain teaser for
both you and your players.

## Learning outcomes

This project will teach you how to work with arrays in Kotlin. You will be dealing with algorithms for generating the
minefield and processing the player moves.
